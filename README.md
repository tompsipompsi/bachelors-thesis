# bachelors-thesis

This repository contains the programming part of my bachelors thesis. 
The goal was to collect data from three different databases (UniProt, BRENDA, PDB),
process it so that connection between different data from different databases could 
be put together, and construct a ridge regression machine learning model. The goal was 
to be able to predict the chemical properties of the protein based on the proteins 
3D-structure. 

Currently the accuracy is not good enough to have any practical solutions. The main reason 
for the poor accuracy is that the size of the used training dataset is too small.
